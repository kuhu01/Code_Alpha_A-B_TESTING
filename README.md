# A/B TESTING ON E-COMMERCE WEBSITE
## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to conduct A/B testing for an e-commerce website to see if changes to the site impact user behavior, specifically focusing on conversion rates.

## Project Objective
The main goal of this A/B test is to determine if a new webpage layout (treatment group) leads to a higher conversion rate compared to the existing layout (control group).

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about user interactions with the website:
- `user_id`: Unique user identifier.
- `group`: Group to which the user belongs (`control` or `treatment`).
- `converted`: Whether the user converted (1 for yes, 0 for no).
- `timestamp`: The date and time of the user interaction.

## Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and organizing the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset and checking conversion rates for both groups.
3. **A/B Testing**: Using statistical techniques to analyze if there's a significant difference between the control and treatment groups.
4. **Conclusion**: Drawing insights from the analysis to decide if the new webpage layout is effective.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: Numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Statsmodels**: Statistical analysis.

## Results
Based on the analysis, the A/B testing results will help determine if the changes to the website positively impact user conversions.

## Conclusion
After conducting the A/B test, the conclusions will guide whether to implement the changes permanently or stick to the original design.
